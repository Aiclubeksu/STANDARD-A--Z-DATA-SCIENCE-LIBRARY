STATISTICS AND PROBABILITY:
Statistics and probability are one of a kind, learn descriptive and inferential, associative and differential statistical concepts & probability (conditional probability & Bayeâ€™s Theorem).
Probability is about predicting the likelihood of future events, while statistics is the gathering, analyzing, interpreting, and drawing conclusions from empirical data.
